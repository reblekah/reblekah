- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rebekah,

I am currently using STAC, SciKit, and Xarray to analyze satellite imagery and build methodology and frameworks to detect invasive annual grasses and build habitat suitability models using high resolution climate data.

I'm looking to collaborate on machine learning or AI-based applications of these detection algorithms or advanced methods for invasive species detection or identification
